- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cahucadi, for now I'm cleaning up my entire GitHub (there were a lot of very old projects) so I'll upload everything from scratch. 
I will also upload other projects by ordering them by topic so that you can find them more easily.

For my students of Competitive Programming, Data Structures and Software Engineering, I ask for your patience, soon all the material will be available again. 

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software engineering and Data Science and new tools and frameworks!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning QA and DS
- ðŸ“« If need help with any topic of interest, contact me! cahucadi at gmail.com
